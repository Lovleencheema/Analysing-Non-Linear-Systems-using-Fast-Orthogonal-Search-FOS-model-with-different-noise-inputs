# Analysing-Non-Linear-Systems-using-Fast-Orthogonal-Search-FOS-model-with-different-noise-inputs

Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) model is used to identify and analyze non-linear systems. We use FOS method to analyze the behavior of three sets of non-linear system of equations and then identify the best model for each of them by comparing the models. Initially, the systems were provided with no noise percentages ,that is, 0% but after noiseless analyzing, we add  25%, 50% and 100%  noise individually and the experiment is done across 3000 data points. All the equations are of second order.
